This folder contains the dataset JSON file (`example.json`) and per-case subfolders.  
Each case folder may include **preregistered images** (used directly for training/inference) and **raw images** to be processed with `register_images.py`.  
Outputs from registration are stored under each caseâ€™s `aligned_data/` subfolder.
