This repository provides the PyTorch implementation for CT to Cone beam CT registration-segmentation method for thoracic CT/CBCTs described in our paper [One shot PACS: Patient specific Anatomic Context and Shape prior aware recurrent registration-segmentation of longitudinal thoracic cone beam CTs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35213307/) accepted to IEEE Trans Med Imaging 2022. 

# Description
Image-guided adaptive lung radiotherapy requires accurate tumor and organs segmentation from during treatment cone-beam CT (CBCT) images. Thoracic CBCTs are hard to segment because of low soft-tissue contrast, imaging artifacts, respiratory motion, and large treatment induced intra-thoracic anatomic changes. Hence, we developed a deep learning based deformable image registration-segmentation approach to simultaneously register planning CT to treatment cone beam CTs as well as segment tumors on the cone beam CT. Deformable image registration provides the ability to warp radiation doses to perform deformable dose mapping and dose accumulation for adaptive radiation treatment and outcomes studies. Segmentation of tumors would allow to automatically track tumor volume changes during treatment from the cone beam CT images. Our implementation can also segment the esophagus from cone beam CT images.
